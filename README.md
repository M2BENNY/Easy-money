1.03xChasingRandom
That's a custom made script. Basically a martingale, but with a lot of parameters. There is a nice interface for you to adjust your betting strategy. You can use it to chase any multiplier.
1.35xChasingSmart.js
In this script you can set the number of games that you want to wait before chasing . Once this number of games is reached, it will bet the 'base bet' value that you sen when starting the script and double the bet when needed, to stay in profit.
2x Chasing
This script will chase the x2 multiplier. It will begin to bet only after the number of red games that you input. After that, it will begin a martingale until there is a green game.
Reverse Martingale
The idea of this script is to bet more after a won game, and return to base bet when you lost a game. In order to make profit, you can set a limit of won games, to go back to the base bet after a won game.
Growing Payout
Here instead making the bet grow, we grow the payout. There is a minimum and maximum payout to input. If it goes until the maximum, the script is reversing the process to lower the damage.
